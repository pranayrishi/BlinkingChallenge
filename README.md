# 🚀 Blink Challenge

**Blink Challenge** is a hilariously intense browser-based space survival game where every blink makes the game harder. Dodge asteroids, fly your spaceship, and try *not to blink*—because every time you do, the chaos ramps up.

> 🎮 **Don’t blink. Just survive.**

---

## 🧠 Inspiration

We wanted to create something truly unique—where real human behavior directly influenced gameplay. Blinking is automatic, uncontrollable, and universal. Turning that into the *core mechanic* of a game? That’s where the fun began.

---

## 🕹️ Gameplay

- **Control** your spaceship using `WASD` or arrow keys
- **Dodge** asteroids flying toward you at increasing speeds
- **Blink**, and the difficulty increases: more asteroids, faster movement, screen shakes, and intense visuals
- **Real-time webcam detection** tracks your eyes using brightness changes
- **Live HUD** displays your score, blink count, and difficulty level
- **Neon visuals** and immersive effects for an engaging space aesthetic

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5 Canvas** for smooth rendering at 60fps
- **JavaScript** for core game logic and blink-based difficulty scaling
- **WebRTC & getUserMedia API** for webcam access and real-time eye monitoring
- **Custom computer vision** logic for blink detection based on brightness variance

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🧠 Blink detection through brightness tracking
- 💥 Particle effects and screen shake feedback
- 📈 Dynamic difficulty scaling tied to blinks
- 🧪 Calibrated for accuracy (minimal false positives)
- 🌌 Neon aesthetics for a sleek, futuristic look

---

## 🤯 Challenges

- Creating accurate blink detection without machine learning
- Maintaining 60fps performance while analyzing live video input
- Tuning the difficulty ramp so it’s fun, not frustrating

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments

- Successfully merged computer vision and browser gaming
- Invented a new genre of “reflex-based difficulty escalation”
- Built a unique gameplay loop that’s unpredictable and hilarious

---

## 📚 What We Learned

- Deepened understanding of video processing using raw webcam data
- Improved optimization skills to reduce latency and lag
- Learned how player psychology (like resisting blinks) can enhance engagement

---

## 🚧 Future Plans

- Integrate TensorFlow.js for advanced eye-tracking
- Add leaderboards, power-ups, and new enemy types
- Improve mobile support and accessibility
- Launch as a full web app or Chrome experiment
